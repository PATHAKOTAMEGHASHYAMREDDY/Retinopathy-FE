# Retinopathy-FE

Front-end application for a diabetic retinopathy screening interface.  
Built using **React** and **Vite**, this project provides a responsive UI to visualize and interact with retinopathy detection tools.

## Overview

Diabetic retinopathy is a common eye condition caused by diabetes that can lead to vision loss if not detected early. Automated tools that process retinal fundus images and classify disease severity are critical components of modern screening workflows. This front-end complements such machine learning systems by offering a user-friendly interface to upload images, view predictions, and interpret results.

## Features

- React + Vite powered UI  
- Image upload component for retinal fundus scans  
- Result display area for model predictions  
- Live deployment link available

## Live Demo
